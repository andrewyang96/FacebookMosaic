<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We use technologies like cookies (small files stored by your browser), web beacons, or unique device identifiers to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.</p>

<p>We also may collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. With your permission, we may also access other personal information on your device, such as your phone book, calendar or messages, in order to provide services to you. If authorized by you, we may also access profile and other information from services like Facebook.</p>

<p>Our systems are not designed to associate personal information with your activities (such as pages you view or things you click on or search for).</p>

<p>We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.</p>

<p>We do not collect, use or share your precise geographic location.</p>

<p>You can sign into your Facebook account to see any personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your name, email, address or phone number. You can also contact us by email to request to see this information.</p>

<p>Our systems are designed to retain log data for up to 2 hours (per Facebook API) after it is collected. We remove personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email or phone number) and other preferences associated with your account promptly after you delete your account.</p>

<p>We generally do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies.</p>

<p>We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting.</p>

<p>In order to serve you, we may share your personal and anonymous information with other companies, including vendors and contractors. Their use of information is limited to these purposes, and subject to agreements that require them to keep the information confidential. Our vendors provide assurance that they take reasonable steps to safeguard the data they hold on our behalf, although data security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Analytics companies may access anonymous data (such as your IP address or device ID) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data solely on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user.</p>

<p>We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. We encrypt transmission of data on pages where you provide payment information. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.</p>
